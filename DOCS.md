## Aero System Config Tool → juxt/aero
The Aero system configuration tool, provided by the `juxt/aero` library, is a configuration library for Clojure
applications. It leverages EDN (Extensible Data Notation) for defining configuration files and provides features to
handle various configuration needs like environment-specific settings, type coercion, and more.

### Key Features of Aero:
#### EDN Files
EDN (Extensible Data Notation) is a subset of Clojure used for data interchange. It is often used in configuration files for Clojure applications. To use EDN files in your project:
1. Create a `.edn` file for your configuration data.
2. Use the EDN format to structure your data in a human-readable way.

#### Multi Profiles
Multi profiles allow you to manage different configuration settings for various environments (e.g., development, testing, production):
1. Define multiple profiles in your EDN configuration file.
2. Use a profile key to switch between different sets of configurations.

#### ENV Keys
ENV keys are used to reference environment variables in your configuration:
1. Use the `#:env` prefix in your EDN file to denote environment variables.
2. Ensure your environment variables are set correctly in your system or deployment environment.

#### Type Coercion
Type coercion ensures that configuration values are automatically converted to the appropriate data types:
1. Define the expected types in your EDN file.
2. Use a library like Aero to handle the type coercion based on the defined schema.

### Aero System Config Tool → juxt/aero

**Explanation:**

The Aero system configuration tool, provided by the `juxt/aero` library, is a configuration library for Clojure applications. It leverages EDN (Extensible Data Notation) for defining configuration files and provides features to handle various configuration needs like environment-specific settings, type coercion, and more.

#### Key Features of Aero:

1. **EDN Files**:
   - **What**: Uses EDN format for configuration files, which is a subset of Clojure's syntax designed for data interchange.
   - **Why**: EDN files are human-readable, easy to write, and support rich data structures.

2. **Multi Profiles**:
   - **What**: Supports defining multiple profiles within a single configuration file.
   - **Why**: Allows you to manage different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) within the same file.

3. **ENV Keys**:
   - **What**: Allows referencing environment variables directly within the configuration file.
   - **Why**: Enables dynamic configuration based on the environment in which the application is running, enhancing flexibility and security.

4. **Type Coercion**:
   - **What**: Automatically converts configuration values to the appropriate data types based on the schema defined in the configuration.
   - **Why**: Ensures that configuration values are interpreted correctly as the intended data types, reducing the risk of errors.

#### Basic Usage Example:
Here is a simple example to illustrate how Aero can be used:
1. **EDN Configuration File (`config.edn`)**:

   ```clojure
   {
     ;; Define profiles
     :profiles
     {
       :dev {:db-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/dev-db"}
       :prod {:db-url "jdbc:postgresql://prod-db-server/prod-db"}
     }

     ;; Reference environment variables
     :api-key #:env "API_KEY"

     ;; Use type coercion for port number
     :server-port ^:int 8080
   }
   ```

2. **Clojure Code to Read Configuration**:

   ```clojure
   (ns my-app.config
     (:require [aero.core :refer (read-config)]))

   (def config (read-config "config.edn"))

   ;; Access configuration values
   (def db-url (:db-url config))
   (def api-key (:api-key config))
   (def server-port (:server-port config))
   ```

In this example:
- Multiple profiles (`:dev` and `:prod`) are defined, allowing the application to switch between different database URLs based on the environment.
- The `:api-key` is retrieved from an environment variable, making the configuration flexible and secure.
- The `:server-port` is coerced to an integer type, ensuring the value is correctly interpreted.

Aero simplifies managing configuration in Clojure applications, making it easier to maintain and adapt to different environments and requirements.

## Create a New Repository on the Command Line

There are two different ways to create and connect a project to GitHub:
1. Create a project from scratch using the terminal.
2. Connect an already existing project to GitHub.

#### 1. How to Create a Project from Scratch

To create a new repository and push it to GitHub from the command line, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `README.md` file**:
   ```sh
   echo "# artchess" >> README.md
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command creates a new file named `README.md` and adds a line with the text `# artchess` to it. The `README.md` file is typically used to provide information about your project.

2. **Initialize a New Git Repository**:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command initializes a new Git repository in your current directory. It creates a `.git` directory that contains all the necessary files and structures for version control.

3. **Add `README.md` to the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git add README.md
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command stages the `README.md` file, marking it for inclusion in the next commit.

4. **Commit the Staged Files**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "first commit"
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command commits the staged files with the message "first commit". Commits are snapshots of your repository at specific points in time.

5. **Create and Switch to the Main Branch**:
   ```sh
   git branch -M main
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command creates a new branch named `main` and switches to it. The `-M` flag renames the current branch to `main`.

6. **Add Remote Repository**:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin git@github.com:VictorInacio/artchess.git
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command adds a remote repository named `origin`. The remote repository is hosted on GitHub, and the URL specifies where the repository is located.

7. **Push to the Remote Repository**:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command pushes your local commits to the `main` branch of the remote repository. The `-u` flag sets the remote `origin` as the default upstream for the `main` branch.

---

#### 2. How to Connect an Existing Project to a Remote Repository

To connect an existing project to a remote repository, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a New Git Repository (if not already initialized)**:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command initializes a new Git repository in your current directory if it has not already been initialized.

2. **Stage All Files**:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command stages all files in the current directory for inclusion in the next commit.

3. **Commit the Staged Files**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command commits the staged files with the message "Initial commit".

4. **Create and Switch to the Main Branch**:
   ```sh
   git branch -M main
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command creates a new branch named `main` and switches to it. The `-M` flag renames the current branch to `main`.

5. **Add Remote Repository**:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin git@github.com:VictorInacio/artchess.git
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command adds a remote repository named `origin`. The remote repository is hosted on GitHub, and the URL specifies where the repository is located.

6. **Push to the Remote Repository**:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   **Explanation**: This command pushes your local commits to the `main` branch of the remote repository. The `-u` flag sets the remote `origin` as the default upstream for the `main` branch.



## Maven Dependency Structure Explanation

In a Clojure project, dependencies are managed using the `deps.edn` file, which is a data-oriented way of specifying dependencies, unlike Maven's XML format. Here's how to interpret the Maven dependency for `org.clojure/java.jdbc`:

#### Dependency Declaration

```clojure
{:deps
 {org.clojure/java.jdbc {:mvn/version "0.7.12"}}
}
```

- **`:deps`**: This key in `deps.edn` specifies the dependencies map where you define all the libraries your project depends on.

- **`org.clojure/java.jdbc`**: This is the coordinate identifier for the dependency. It consists of:
   - **Group ID (`org.clojure`)**: Indicates the group or organization that maintains the library. In this case, it's Clojure itself (`org.clojure`).
   - **Artifact ID (`java.jdbc`)**: Identifies the specific library or artifact within the group. Here, `java.jdbc` refers to the Clojure library for JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

- **`:mvn/version "0.7.12"`**: This specifies the version of the library you want to use. It follows the Maven versioning syntax, where `"0.7.12"` is the version number of the `java.jdbc` library.

### How Maven Dependencies Work

- **Group ID**: Identifies the organization or group responsible for the library.
- **Artifact ID**: Specifies the specific library or module within the group.
- **Version**: Specifies the version of the library to use. It follows semantic versioning principles (`major.minor.patch`).

### Importance of Maven in Dependency Management

- **Consistency**: Maven provides a standardized way to manage dependencies across projects.
- **Automation**: Tools like `clj` or `lein` automate the fetching and management of dependencies based on `deps.edn` specifications.
- **Compatibility**: Ensures that compatible versions of libraries are used, reducing compatibility issues.

### Summary

The Maven dependency declaration `org.clojure/java.jdbc {:mvn/version "0.7.12"}` in your `deps.edn` file specifies that 
your Clojure project requires version `0.7.12` of the `java.jdbc` library from the `org.clojure` group. Maven coordinates 
(`group ID`, `artifact ID`, `version`) are crucial for specifying and managing dependencies effectively in Clojure projects.


## Using `com.github.seancorfield/honeysql` for Database Queries

#### Explanation

`com.github.seancorfield/honeysql` is a library in Clojure that facilitates building SQL queries programmatically using Clojure data structures instead of strings. This approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and safety against SQL injection attacks.

#### Maven Dependency

Add `honeysql` to your `deps.edn` file:

```clojure
{:deps
 {com.github.seancorfield/honeysql {:mvn/version "0.6.2"}}
}
```

#### Basic Examples

Let's explore how to use `honeysql` for common database operations.

##### 1. Select Query

```clojure
(ns your-app.db
  (:require [honeysql.core :as sql]
            [honeysql.helpers :refer [select]]))

;; Construct a select query
(def select-query
  (-> (select :*)
      (sql/from :users)
      (sql/where [:= :status "active"])
      sql/format))

(println "Generated SQL query:" select-query)
```

- **Explanation**:
   - `select :*` constructs a `SELECT *` statement.
   - `sql/from :users` specifies the table `users`.
   - `sql/where [:= :status "active"]` adds a `WHERE status = 'active'` condition.
   - `sql/format` converts the query data structure into a SQL string.

##### 2. Insert Query

```clojure
(ns your-app.db
  (:require [honeysql.core :as sql]
            [honeysql.helpers :refer [insert]]))

;; Construct an insert query
(def insert-query
  (-> (insert-into :users)
      (sql/values {:name "Alice" :age 30}))
      sql/format))

(println "Generated SQL query:" insert-query)
```

- **Explanation**:
   - `insert-into :users` specifies the `INSERT INTO users` statement.
   - `sql/values {:name "Alice" :age 30}` specifies the values to insert into the table.
   - `sql/format` converts the query data structure into a SQL string.

##### 3. Update Query

```clojure
(ns your-app.db
  (:require [honeysql.core :as sql]
            [honeysql.helpers :refer [update]]))

;; Construct an update query
(def update-query
  (-> (update :users)
      (sql/set-fields {:age 31})
      (sql/where [:= :name "Alice"]))
      sql/format))

(println "Generated SQL query:" update-query)
```

- **Explanation**:
   - `update :users` constructs the `UPDATE users` statement.
   - `sql/set-fields {:age 31}` specifies the fields to update (`age` set to `31`).
   - `sql/where [:= :name "Alice"]` adds a `WHERE name = 'Alice'` condition.
   - `sql/format` converts the query data structure into a SQL string.



## Where code found in project, structure example

1. **`src` Directory:**
    - **`src`**: The main source code directory where the application's code is stored.

2. **`resources` Directory:**
    - **`resources`**: A directory for storing non-code resources such as configuration files, static files, and other assets.

In many projects, you might see paths defined like this:

- **`src`**: Contains all the source code files.
- **`resources`**: Contains all the resource files needed by the application.

Example structure:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       ├── app/
│       │   └── main.py
│       └── utils/
│           └── helper.py
└── resources/
    └── config/
        └── settings.yaml
```

This structure helps in maintaining a clean separation between code and resources, making the project easier to navigate and manage.

## Adding Frontend in Our Applications

1. **Create `public` Directory in `resources`:**
    - **Step:** Create a `public` directory inside the `resources` directory.
    - **Purpose:** To store frontend-related files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Create `index.html`:**
    - **Step:** Inside the `public` directory, create an `index.html` file.
    - **Important Detail:** Ensure that the `<script src="js/main.js"></script>` tag correctly points to the `main.js` file path.
    The main.js file will be generated by shadow-cljs during the build process. This is configured in the shadow-cljs settings 
    with the :output-dir option, which specifies that the compiled JavaScript files will be placed in the resources/public/js directory.
    - **Purpose:** This file serves as the entry point for the frontend application.

3. **Create and Set Up Shadow-cljs.edn File and Settings:**
    - **Step:** In the root directory of your project, create a `shadow-cljs.edn` file.
    - **Purpose:** To configure the shadow-cljs build tool for your project.
    - **Detail:**
        - **Build Configuration:** Define a build configuration for your app. This includes specifying the target platform, entry points, and output directory.
        - **Output Directory:** Ensure that the `:output-dir` option in the build configuration matches the path specified in the `<script>` tag of your `index.html` file.
        - **Entry Point:** The `:entries` option in the `:modules` section specifies the namespace that serves as the entry point for the application. This should match the namespace where your main initialization function is defined.
        - **Initialization Function:** The `:init-fn` option specifies the function to call to initialize the application. This should be a fully qualified symbol pointing to your initialization function.

4. **Create `app` Directory in `src`:**
    - **Step:** Inside the `src` directory, create an `app` directory to hold frontend code.
    - **File:** Create a `core.cljs` file and add the app component as the initial page.
    - **Purpose:** To keep frontend code organized and separate from backend code.

5. **Create `shadow-cljs.edn` File:**
    - **Step:** In the root directory of your project, create a `shadow-cljs.edn` file.
    - **Purpose:** To configure the shadow-cljs build tool for your project.

                :release          {:build-options {:ns-aliases {day8.re-frame.tracing day8.re-frame.tracing-stubs}}}  ;; Release-specific build options
               }
          }
}
```


### Key Points to Remember:
- **`:output-dir` must match the directory specified in your `index.html` file’s `<script src="js/main.js"></script>` tag.** This ensures the generated `main.js` file is correctly linked.
- **`:init-fn` must point to the correct initialization function in your ClojureScript code.** This function is responsible for rendering your frontend application.

# **How Dispatch, Event Handling, Subscription Triangle works**

### **Re-frame Overview**

Re-frame is a ClojureScript framework for building web applications using a reactive and functional approach. It follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, which simplifies the management of state and side effects.

### **Core Concepts**

1. **Events**: Represent user interactions or other actions that modify the application's state. Events are dispatched and handled by event handlers.

2. **Subscriptions**: Provide a way to read data from the application's state and pass it to components. Subscriptions automatically re-calculate and trigger re-renders when the state they depend on changes.

3. **Dispatch**: The mechanism used to send events into the application’s event handling system. Dispatching an event triggers a chain of actions that ultimately leads to a state update.

### **Detailed Lifecycle of Events**

#### **1. Defining Events**

Events are defined using `rf/reg-event-db` (for database changes) or `rf/reg-event-fx` (for side effects). An event handler takes the current state and event arguments, processes them, and returns a new state.

**Example: Define an Event Handler to Increment a Counter**

```clojure
(rf/reg-event-db
  :increment-counter
  (fn [db _]
    ;; Increment the counter in the application state
    (update db :counter inc)))
```

- `:increment-counter` is the event name.
- `db` is the current application state.
- `update db :counter inc` increments the value of the `:counter` key in the state.

#### **2. Dispatching Events**

Dispatching an event sends it to the event handling system, which then invokes the appropriate event handler.

**Example: Dispatch an Event on Button Click**

```clojure
(defn increment-button []
  ($ :button {:onClick #(rf/dispatch [:increment-counter])} "Increment"))
```

- `rf/dispatch` sends the `:increment-counter` event to the event handling system.
- When the button is clicked, the `:increment-counter` event is dispatched.

#### **3. Event Handling**

The event handler processes the event and updates the application state. The updated state is then used to re-render the UI.

**Example Event Handler**

```clojure
(rf/reg-event-db
  :increment-counter
  (fn [db _]
    (update db :counter inc)))
```

- This handler updates the `:counter` key in the state by incrementing its value.

#### **4. State Update**

The event handler updates the application's state, which is managed by Re-frame’s database. The state update triggers recalculation of subscriptions that depend on the changed state.

**Example Initial State**

```clojure
(def initial-state
  {:counter 0})
```

#### **5. Subscriptions**

Subscriptions are used to read specific parts of the application state and provide them to components. When the state changes, subscriptions are recalculated.

**Example Subscription**

```clojure
(rf/reg-sub
  :counter
  (fn [db _]
    (:counter db)))
```

- `:counter` is the subscription name.
- The subscription function extracts the `:counter` value from the state.

#### **6. Using Subscriptions in Components**

Components use subscriptions to get the data they need to render. When a subscription’s underlying state changes, the component re-renders with the new data.

**Example Component Using Subscription**

```clojure
(defui counter-component []
  (let [counter (hooks/use-subscribe [:counter])]
    ($ :div
      ($ :h3 "Counter: " counter))))
```

- `hooks/use-subscribe` is used to get the current value of the `:counter` subscription.
- The component re-renders whenever the `:counter` value changes.

### **Complete Example: Counter Application**

Here's a complete example showing the entire flow:

1. **Event Registration**

   ```clojure
   (rf/reg-event-db
     :increment-counter
     (fn [db _]
       (update db :counter inc)))
   ```

2. **Subscription Registration**

   ```clojure
   (rf/reg-sub
     :counter
     (fn [db _]
       (:counter db)))
   ```

3. **Component Using Subscription**

   ```clojure
   (defui counter-component []
     (let [counter (hooks/use-subscribe [:counter])]
       ($ :div
         ($ :h3 "Counter: " counter))))
   ```

4. **Dispatch Event on User Interaction**

   ```clojure
   (defn increment-button []
     ($ :button {:onClick #(rf/dispatch [:increment-counter])} "Increment"))
   ```

### **Flow Diagram**

Here’s a simplified flow of the dispatch event process:

1. **User Interaction**  
   (e.g., button click triggers `onClick`)

2. **Event Dispatch**  
   (`rf/dispatch [:increment-counter]`)

3. **Event Handling**  
   (`:increment-counter` event is processed by its handler)

4. **State Update**  
   (Application state is updated)

5. **Subscription Recalculation**  
   (Subscriptions that depend on the updated state are recalculated)

6. **Component Re-rendering**  
   (UI components are re-rendered with new state data)

### **Summary**

- **Events** represent actions and are dispatched to modify state.
- **Subscriptions** extract and provide state data to components.
- **Dispatch** triggers the entire process, leading to state updates and UI changes.

# Purpose of `app.hooks` Namespace

The `app.hooks` namespace provides custom hooks that integrate Reagent's reaction system with React’s hooks API. This namespace is crucial for managing and synchronizing state between Re-frame subscriptions and Reagent components in a way that aligns with React's component lifecycle.

### Key Functions

1. **`use-batched-subscribe`**:
    - Manages listeners for changes to an atom-like reference (`ref`). It ensures that all registered listeners are notified when the reference changes and handles cleanup when listeners are removed.

2. **`use-sync-external-store`**:
    - Facilitates subscription to an external store using React’s `useSyncExternalStore` hook. This ensures that components can stay in sync with external state sources by getting the current snapshot and updating when changes occur.

3. **`run-reaction`**:
    - Manages Reagent reactions by scheduling updates and notifying listeners in batches. This function is used to ensure that changes in Reagent's reaction system are properly handled and applied.

4. **`use-reaction`**:
    - Integrates Reagent reactions with React’s hooks system. It subscribes components to changes in Reagent reactions and returns the current value of the reaction. This allows React components to respond to state changes managed by Reagent.

5. **`use-subscribe`**:
    - Provides a hook for subscribing to Re-frame subscriptions. It creates and manages a subscription to a Re-frame query, ensuring that React components stay updated with the latest state from Re-frame.

### Summary

The `app.hooks` namespace is essential for bridging the gap between Reagent and React. It enables seamless state management and synchronization between Reagent’s reaction system and React’s hooks, allowing for efficient and reactive UI updates.
